# MapPreview

Notepad++ plugin for viewing geometries included in text files, like GeoJSON, WKT etc.
For reading vector geospatial data formats I'm experimenting with GDAL and GEOS.
Main purpose of a project is to have ability to preview some vector files in Notepad++ without installing specialized software like QGIS, ArcGIS, CAD viewers.

## Screenshots

Currently main plugin features are is still under development, like reading and showing geometry data, but some examples of GUI are prepared.
